# Brightness-Control-Using-Hand-Gesture
OpenCV is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks like face detection, objection tracking, landmark detection, and much more.

MediaPipe is an open-source framework for building pipelines to perform computer vision inference over arbitrary sensory data such as video or audio. Using MediaPipe, such a perception pipeline can be built as a graph of modular components. MediaPipe is currently in alpha at v0.
